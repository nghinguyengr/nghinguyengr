## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a dedicated **Software Engineer** specializing in **mobile application development and embedded systems**, with a significant background in **image processing**, **efficient data transfer**, **video streaming**, **map services**, **Firebase backend integration**, **native library integration for Android**, and **API integration**. I thrive on tackling complex technical challenges and delivering robust, high-performance solutions.

My core expertise spans:

* **Mobile Development:**
    * **Flutter:** Crafting engaging, cross-platform mobile experiences with a strong focus on UI/UX and performance.
    * **Android Native (Kotlin/Java):** Building robust, optimized Android applications, proficient in both the traditional **View System (XML-based UI)** and modern UI development with **Jetpack Compose**. My expertise includes integrating **C/C++ native libraries via JNI/NDK** for performance-critical components.
* **Embedded Systems & Low-Level Programming:**
    * **C/C++:** Developing for embedded platforms, optimizing algorithms, and interacting directly with hardware.
    * **Qt Framework:** Building powerful, cross-platform graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and applications for desktop and embedded systems using C++.
* **Image Processing:**
    * Implementing algorithms for image analysis, manipulation, and feature extraction.
* **Data Transfer & API Integration:**
    * Designing and implementing efficient protocols for reliable data exchange. Extensive experience in **consuming and integrating various APIs** (e.g., RESTful services, third-party SDKs) for mobile and backend communication.
* **Video Streaming:**
    * Experience with various streaming protocols, video encoding/decoding, live stream implementation, and efficient video playback on mobile/embedded devices.
* **Map Services:**
    * Integrating and customizing popular map APIs (e.g., Google Maps, Mapbox), developing location-based features, geofencing, and custom map overlays.
* **Firebase Integration:**
    * Proficient in utilizing Firebase services for mobile application backends, including Authentication, Cloud Firestore/Realtime Database, Cloud Functions, Storage, and Analytics.

I'm particularly interested in projects at the intersection of mobile technology, embedded hardware, real-time data, and geographical information systems.
